This project goal was to open multi-instances of browsers each going to a specific web page and automatically log in.
These were mostly banking web sites with multi-steps log in autentication processes, therfore really resulting in a very slow workflow.
In fact, they were at least 7 log ins each requiring multiple user inputs (usernames, passwords, verification codes, etc...) and being done multiple times per day.
Of course, the launch of this code was highly sensitive and protected by a masterpassword.

(Clearly I've ereased from the code every sensisble information)
