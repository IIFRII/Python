# Python
Just some code that Iâ€™ve written or, mostly, scraped together along the way; please consider that I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER or software engineer. These are simple tools to improve efficiency and save time automating whenever possibile.

# Tools (in no particular order):
1. **Open set of web pages and auto login**: mostly used to auto login restricted banks websites.
2. **Open set of web pages** needed to do a particular tasks.
3. **Open set of files** often used togheter.
4. **Launch a certain software then perform action\actions**: used it a lot to launch old softwares, do a certain amount of clicks and skip a certain amount of steps before reaching the desired phase.
5. **Do a X amount of clicks with or without a time-delay**: used it to navigate UI with predefined loading times.
6. **Random option chooser.**
7. ~~**Download a financial statement, transpose it to excel then perform some calculations. Save the file to further view it.**~~
8. ~~**An example of simple stock analisys.**~~
9. **Extract text from digitalized PDF (imaged based PDFs, non text based PDF)** using HP\Google engine **Tesseract OCR**. Used it to speed up the workflow, avoiding tedious typing-copying.
10. **Scrape tables and data from text based PDFs using Tabula**. Used it countless times to extract data from pdfs long thousands of pages and then import it, clean it with Power Pivot (Excel) and use it.
