# Python
Here you can find some code that Iâ€™ve written or, mostly, scraped together along the way -from my first job to the current one-; please consider that I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER. These are simple tools to improve efficiency and save time. Also, I get bored pretty fast doing mindless tasks, so I try to be creative and automate the tedious stuff.

# Tools:
1. **Open set of web pages and log in**: mostly used to auto log in restricted banks websites;
2. **Open set of web pages** needed to do a particular job;
3. **Open set of files**;
4. **Launch a certain software then perform an action**: used it a lot to launch old enterprise software, do a certain amount of clicks and skip a certain amount of steps before reaching the desired phase;
5. **Do a X amount of click with or without time-delay**: used it a lot to do useless e-learning courses (please consideer that some e-learning courses are very useful)
