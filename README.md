# Python
Just some code that Iâ€™ve written or, mostly, scraped together along the way -from my first job to the current one-; please consider that I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER. These are simple tools to improve efficiency and save time automating whenever possibile.

# Tools (in no particular order):
1. **Open set of web pages and auto login**: mostly used to auto login restricted banks websites;
2. **Open set of web pages** needed to do a particular job;
3. **Open set of files** often used togheter;
4. **Launch a certain software then perform action\actions**: used it a lot to launch old enterprise softwares, do a certain amount of clicks and skip a certain amount of steps before reaching the desired phase;
5. **Do a X amount of clicks with or without a time-delay**: used it to skip some e-learning courses (please consider that some e-learning courses are very useful)
6. **Random option chooser**
7. **Download a financial statement, transpose it to excel then perform some calculations. Save the file to further view it.**
8. **An example of simple stock analisys**
9. **Extract text from digitalized PDF (imaged based PDF, non text based PDF)** using HP\Google engine Tesseract OCR. Used it to speed up the workflow of my teams, avoiding tedious typing-copying.
